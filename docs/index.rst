Pixel Prism Documentation
=========================

Pixel Prism is a creative coding toolkit for building procedural visuals, animations,
and custom rendering workflows in Python. The library combines animation helpers,
effect pipelines, and GPU-friendly building blocks so you can mix Node-graph style
authoring with regular Python scripting.

Getting Started
---------------

Install the package with ``pip install pixelprism`` and explore the guides below to
learn how to compose nodes, write expressions, and animate scenes. Each guide links
to runnable examples and highlights the modules involved so you can jump straight to
