class ScalarToScalarAddition(MathOperator, ABC):
    """
    A mathematical operator that adds two scalar values.

    This class represents an addition operation between two Scalar objects.
    It computes the sum of the two scalars and updates automatically when
    either of the operands changes.

    Example:
        ```python
        # Create two scalar values
        a = Scalar(5)
        b = Scalar(10)

        # Create an addition operator
        sum_op = ScalarToScalarAddition(a, b)

        # Get the result
        print(sum_op.value)  # 15

        # When an operand changes, the result updates automatically
        a.value = 7
        print(sum_op.value)  # 17
        ```

    Attributes:
        expr_type (str): The type of expression ("Addition").
        return_type (str): The type of value returned ("Scalar").
        arity (int): The number of operands (2 for binary addition).
    """

    # Expression type - identifies the category of mathematical operator

    # Return type - specifies the type of value returned by this operator
    return_type = "Scalar"

    # Arity - number of operands this operator takes (2 for binary addition)
    arity = 2

        Initialize a new ScalarToScalarAddition operator.

        This constructor sets up the addition operator with its two scalar operands
        and registers listeners to detect when their values change.

        Args:
            scalar1 (Scalar): The first scalar operand.
            scalar2 (Scalar): The second scalar operand.
            on_change (Optional[Callable[[MathEventData], None]]): Function to call when the result changes.
                The function should accept a MathEventData parameter.

        Convert the addition operation to a list representation.

        Returns:
