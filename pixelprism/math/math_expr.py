class MathOperator(MathExpr, ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for mathematical operators that combine multiple expressions.

    MathOperator represents a node in an expression tree that performs an operation
    on one or more child expressions. Examples include arithmetic operations (add, subtract),
    logical operations (and, or), and other operations that combine multiple values.

    The value of a MathOperator is computed based on its children's values. When a child's
    value changes, the operator's value is automatically updated, and the change is
    propagated to any listeners.

    - return_type: The type of value returned (e.g., "Scalar", "Point2D")
    - arity: The number of operands this operator takes (e.g., 2 for binary operations)
    - _get(): Method to compute the value based on children's values

        ```python
        # Example of a binary operator (like Add)
