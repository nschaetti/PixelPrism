**PixelPrism** is a _mathematical animation engine_ you program, not a tool you click.
It turns symbolic expressions, expression graphs, and mathematical structures into animated visuals, effects, and transformations. 
PixelPrism operates at the math layer: you define expressions, relationships, and dynamics — PixelPrism evaluates, animates, and renders them. 
Images, videos, shaders, and effects are not the starting point; they are the result.
